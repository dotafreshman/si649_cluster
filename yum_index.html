  <h4>Introduction to K-means Clustering</h4>
  <a>k-means clustering is an iterative algorithm applied in cluster analysis. K-means clustering aims to partition a set of points distributed within a space into several clusters, whose number determined by the user, according to their locations. Its fundamental procedures are, first randomly initiate some label points on the space, and assign all the points closet to each label as one group, then move the labels to the center of the group points, and reassign all the points into new group according to their distance to the new labels. This procedure is repeated until a stability is achieved, that is labels are all in the center of each group, and no points can be assigned into a new group. K-means is very fundamental but practical, and is widely used in machine learning and data analysis.</a>

  <h4>Procedures:</h4>
  <ul><li>(1) select the number of groups, that you plan to cluster your points into, and click "reset and start a new play"</li></ul>
  <ul><li>(2) click on the canvas, to make some points</li></ul>
  <ul><li>(3) press "step" continuously to see how k-means cluster these points</li></ul>
